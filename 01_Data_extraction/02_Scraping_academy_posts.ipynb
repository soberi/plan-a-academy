It all started in 2017, when former U.S. President Donald Trump decided to “cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes.” However, the process took three years, because no country could give the notice to leave the Paris agreement until three years had passed after ratification.   \n",
