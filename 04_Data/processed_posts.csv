(e.g. carbon emissions released, energy used during the manufacturing process, transportation method) Unfortunately, many companies need to learn more about life-cycle and sustainability accounting 101.

The term was coined by John Mc Carty in 1955, since then, the technology has rapidly advanced. The technology of a machine capable to learn and think on its own has raised both hopes and worries for the future of humankind. As climate change is the biggest challenge facing the planet, what if we harnessed the potential of machine learning to bring solutions for climate action? A lot of discoveries remain to be found for us to truly understand what use we can make of it.",p

534,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"To get a better understanding of how AI could help us to tackle climate change, we first need to understand what the term AI actually means. Artificial Intelligence is a field of science that points to situations in which a machine can simulate human intelligence. It can perform calculations, make interpretations or take decisions that typically require human knowledge. The latter includes the capability to learn from past experience, adapt to new situations and handle abstract ideas. Under AI, we have Symbolic Reasoning and Machine Learning. In Symbolic Reasoning, the human writes an algorithm for a machine on how to give an output based on an input. For example, in a Coca Cola factory, a sensor detects an empty bottle (data) by which it will move a robotic arm and fill the bottle with Coca Cola (output). ",p
535,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"In Machine Learning (ML), the algorithm does not react to the input. Instead, a human writes code. Then, the machine ‘learns’ the algorithm to come to an output. With every new data, the engine will then improve its algorithm. For example, Softbank has developed its robot based on ML, Pepper can interact with humans by reading their emotions, can have a conversation and a throw a ball. This robot is already in use in companies and schools, but is still qualified as a “weak AI”. Now, we may wonder, could we utilize this advancement to develop robots to prevent food waste, or integrate sustainable living in our daily lives?",p
536,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"Deep Learning, a subcategory of ML, is the most sophisticated form of AI. It is inspired directly from the human brain as a neural network. Deep learning recreates the decision-making of humankind. Apart from these categories of AI, there is also a difference in specialist and generalist AI. In this article, we are talking about ‘specialists’ forms of AI, that can perform multiple tasks at the same time. For example, deep learning enables better predictions and estimates of climate change. Research led by Google, the Mila Institute, the German Aerospace Centre demonstrated the critical role that AI has in making sense of the extensive data set on Earth, understanding better climate change, and acting upon it. Down the line, it provides enhanced energy monitoring for buildings and electric cars. AI leads to sufficient energy distribution and battery management, enabling reduced carbon footprint and switching to renewable energies. ",p

538,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"A recent paper named “Tackling climate change with Machine Learning”, conducted by the most prominent researchers in the AI field, disclosed 13 areas where ML can be developed, such as energy consumption, CO2 removal, education, solar engineering and finance. The outcomes encompass monitoring deforestation, creating new low-carbon materials, and greener transportation. However, AI is still at its infancy stage and cannot solve everything.  ",p
539,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,Understanding climate change ,h2
540,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"First of all, AI can help us, in understanding climate change better. Everything from global-scale modelling to individual weather forecasting relies on a massive number of variables, which is impossible for a human brain to do on its own. The interpretation of climate data is based on climate informatics, a discipline created in 2011. It covers a wide range of topics, such as predicting extreme weather events, reconstructing past climate conditions, or the socio-economic impacts of climate change and precipitations. This can help policymakers to take action and save lives. If you as an individual or as a company want to benefit yourself from an improved AI weather forecasting, take a look here.",p
541,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"Nevertheless, the community of scientists and experts on climate modelling claim that models tend to agree in short-term forecasting while diverging for long-term forecasts. There is still a lot of uncertainty, as models do not even agree on how precipitations will change the future. For example, MILA researchers have created an app, to show individuals what their neighbourhood will look like with different climate change outcomes. People are able to upload pictures of bush fires or floods, to ameliorate the algorithm. This concept will be deployed across Canada. ",p
542,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"Algorithms are not only getting better and better for specific weather events, but also for the more global changes and its consequences. An example is to predict the relationship between the measures we take and how fast we will go to the 2°C rise in global temperature. Instead of trying to write complex models based on physical laws (symbolic reasoning), the study of Ise and Oba gave global monthly temperatures of the last 30 years to a neural network. Without any other data, the neural network successfully predicts the rise and fall of warmth for the next 10 years, with an accuracy of 97%. AI could also help to understand the causes of climate change. It could, for example, based on satellite images, detect and map significant CO2 emitting sources in countries where the regulation about reporting is scarce.",p

544,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"A more concrete way in which AI can help us is in reducingCO2 emissions through the optimization of existing systems. ‘Climate Change AI’, a group of volunteers that wants to bring together AI experts and climate science specialists, identified how ML can help in different areas (e.g. electricity systems, transportation, buildings and cities, farms). For example, in electricity systems, that account for ¼ of the global CO2 emissions. Carbon Tracker is an independent financial think tank working towards the UN goal of preventing new coal plants from being built by 2020. It monitors coal plants emissions by using satellites data, and convince the finance industry that it is not profitable. Thanks to a grant from Google, Carbon Tracker is expanding the satellite imagery efforts to include gas-powered plants’ emissions and get a better sense of where air pollution is coming from. Carbon Tracker will analyze emissions for 4000 to 5000 power plants, creating the biggest data bank and make it public. This could help us in having a global perspective, on tackling carbon emissions and reducing air pollution. It will also pinpoint companies responsible for carbon emissions, and implement an emission price. ",p
545,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"Further, then a prediction, the energy consumption can even be managed, e.g. by smart home solutions that charge your car or do your laundry when there is renewable energy available. In industry, AI can be used to optimize processes that require electricity. For example, the Google Data Centers consume 3% of global energy consumption (see also our article on datacenters). Deepmind implemented an ML system to optimize the management of all the settings to cool these datacenters, minimizing energy consumption. The ML continuously performs the optimal configuration of all the gauges and valves, based on its learnings from previous data, and like this, they could reduce the energy consumption with 40%! Microsoft has found another solution: self-sufficient underwater datacenters. Steered with AI, they are cooled by the ocean and powered by wave energy. Imagine that if similar systems are implemented in all industries, what a considerable amount of CO2 emissions could be avoided?",p

547,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"Next to optimizing existing systems, AI can assist in the design of new sustainable products and technologies. By switching from the traditional way of doing things to these new products and technologies, CO2 emissions can be avoided or even reversed. In designing a sustainable product, one has to take into account a significant number of factors like abundancy, toxicity and properties of raw materials, regulations, end-of-life options, price, … A human could not even imagine all the possibilities. Machine learning can incorporate all the constraints, go over all the possible materials and configurations and propose the most optimal combination. In this way, AirBus designed a new 3D printable aeroplane part that is not only lighter than before, reducing CO2 emissions while flying, but also stronger and using less raw materials. ",p
548,https://plana.earth/academy/ai-climate-change/,AI and Climate Change,2020-07-14,"Also, in research and development of technology, ML is getting more and more important. It is a promising tool in designing batteries with a longer life-span and higher energy storage capacity. It could also accelerate the research on nuclear fusion reactors, that can become a safe and carbon-free electricity production alternative. These require an intelligent experimental design as they have a large number of tunable parameters. Or if we dream bigger, and feed a deep learning algorithm with the right data about our universe, maybe it could help us to understand it better, or bring space travelling to a whole other dimension. No need to change the climate on the earth anymore. Thirty years ago we couldn’t even imagine how the internet was going to take over our lives, now, AI could maybe also make it possible to get a grip on our own future as humanity.",p

Naturally, the conversation around sustainability was started at every brand I ever worked for. But what always struck me is that the way the industry is structured right now, it practically demands that we create so much unnecessary stock, which leads to so much compromise. When it came to design, I wanted to be uncompromising with the materials we use. My goal was to create something precious, something desirable and meaningful, and to find an ethical approach to luxury fashion. After years of working by the industry’s rules and bringing other designers’ vision to life, it felt like time to propose a new, fresh and uncompromising take on modern meaningful luxury.",p

Yes, there are more and more sustainable materials becoming available, but few options are available for footwear, and even fewer for luxury footwear. Also, when you look very deeply, you realise that with most of them there is a “but” and a designer has to decide what they stand for and what they are willing to compromise on.

One way of doing it is planting trees, creating new forests, another is maintaining the conditions for natural forests to persist. This latter is the approach I recommend. It involves what we call in ecology as top-down and bottom-up dynamics, or more generally speaking trophic cascades. A sound example of this is being recorded in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). The last wolf present in that area was shot in the ‘30s, until the mid ‘90s, when wolves have been reintroduced, prey and particularly the elk have been doing very well, too well actually. Their population grew over the ecosystem capacity, meaning that they were eating too many young willow, aspen and cottonwood plants. The result of this was that the delicate balance between forests and meadows was being jeopardized, forests were gradually shrinking and other animal species, which apparently have nothing to do with those mentioned so far, were disappearing. One example is the beaver, which needs willows to survive in winter, and that has started recolonizing its natural habitat only after wolves have been reintroduced.

In practical terms, the main threat to large mammals, and not only, is habitat loss. Our species colonised the entire planet and keeps managing the surrounding environment with disturbing superiority, as if our survival didn’t depend on that very environment. As said before, ecosystems are delicate and large mammals are just a part of them but the good side of these species is their high ecological demand. In most cases one needs to work on the entire ecological community to preserve one single mammal species, because that constitutes the habitat for the target species. For this reason, certain species are named ‘umbrella species’, because saving them means saving the habitat they live in.",p

There are local economies relying almost entirely on such resources. This is just one of the possible solutions, the one which is being implemented in Europe.

In bacteria, ABR is the ability to resist the effects of antibiotics that would normally kill the bacteria. The genes that code for resistance occurs naturally at low levels as a response to natural antibiotics produced by other bacteria and fungi. These genes are numerous and can be spread between bacteria via lateral gene transfer. In other words, ABR genes are hugely beneficial to the microbes that harbour them, almost like a genetic ‘get out of jail free card’. But, what about the host?

But we know very little about the dynamics of ABR in the environment. With the widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture, industry, and medicine, antibiotics and ABR have polluted natural environments all over the world. Wildlife living in habitats that are contaminated with these anthropogenic, or man-made, pollutants are at risk of picking up ABR that can propagate in the animal’s microbiomes.

1086,https://plana.earth/academy/antibiotic-resistance-wildlife-ecosystem/,Antibiotic Resistance in Wildlife Population and Wild Ecosystems,2019-11-26,"Wild lemurs live in only one place on the planet; the island of Madagascar. Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot, is home to some of the most fantastical creatures in the world, including over 100 species of lemurs. And, as primates, lemurs are some of our closest genetic relatives. But sadly, they are also one of the most endangered groups of animals on the planet. Habitat destruction threatens lemurs all across the island, including the most easily recognized of all lemurs, the ring-tailed lemur (think King Julien from the Madagascar movies).",p

This ability to survive in tough environments is also why ring-tailed lemurs are often one of the only lemurs that you may see in a zoo. But what this means for wild ring-tailed lemurs is that they inhabit ‘degraded’ habitats that are strongly influenced by humans. Our research focuses on understanding how these anthropogenic factors can impact the microbiomes of lemurs living in Madagascar, specifically through the transmission of microbes and ABR between lemurs and their environments. ",p
1089,https://plana.earth/academy/antibiotic-resistance-wildlife-ecosystem/,Antibiotic Resistance in Wildlife Population and Wild Ecosystems,2019-11-26,"At this point you may be asking, why lemurs and why Madagascar? Well, Madagascar is a unique place to study antimicrobial resistance for a very specific reason: It is one of the only countries in the world that still experiences outbreaks of bacterial plague (yes, like the black plague). Because the plague impacts the health of thousands of Malagasy people, the specific antibiotics used to treat the plague are widely distributed and used across the country.",p

But does this widespread usage of antibiotics by people have an impact on the lemurs? We now know that ABR is present in the gut microbiomes of wild ring-tailed lemurs. And, the types of resistance genes we find in the lemurs are those that reflect the antibiotics specifically used to treat the plague. These findings show that despite never having been given antibiotics, wild lemurs have developed ABR in their microbiomes. So, where they are getting it from? My hunch is that they are likely picking it up from their environments. The next steps will be to analyze soil and water samples from the lemurs’ environments and look for those same ABR genes (check back in a year or two for more results!). ",p

One of these challenges, in parallel to the situation that lemurs face in Madagascar, is the introduction of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the Galapagos.

Do different wildlife species carry different types of ABR genes? What does this all mean for the health and conservation of dear Lonesome George? ",p

She was the minister for the environment from 2003 – 2008 and extended the network of protected areas enormously. This success has been achieved despite high beef and soy prices, which in previous years had pushed deforestation upward, and during a time that Brazil had rapid economic growth and made important progress in reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality.

Warming seas could also result in other shark species expanding their ranges into her waters, leading to our shark being out-competed for food.",p

This makes the species highly vulnerable to overfishing, as sharks can be killed before they have been able to reproduce. Whilst there are no longer any specific commercial fisheries for the Greenland shark, in the 1910s, Greenland caught up to 32,000 each year to meet the demand for its liver oil; and in 1948, a predicted 50,000 individuals were caught in Norway. Although this indicates that, at one point, there were many thousands of Greenland sharks in the sea, there is only so much population decline a species can take – particularly given the slow development of the species. Hundreds of tons of the species are still caught accidentally by shrimp and halibut trawl fisheries around the Arctic.

My goal as a chemistry student was to find a solution for our energy problems in the lab, yet it hadn’t even occurred to me to think about my own life and own behaviours, outside of switching off the lights every now and then. This is the point at which I realised that a technological solution to the climate crisis wasn’t the answer to all of our problems. I began to realise that the problem was much more nuanced, much more political and in turn much more personal too. Having figured that out, I felt like the best thing I go do for the sustainability movement was to try and communicate this to a wider audience. And thus began the spark which led me into journalism.",p

Rivers aren’t just stunningly beautiful; they are the arteries of the planet, moving nutrients and vital sediment from land to ocean and feeding plankton and fish. They provide clean water for millions of people. Rivers also transport about 200 million tons of carbon to the ocean each year, effectively taking it out of the atmosphere, helping us combat climate change. That’s the equivalent of more than 10 percent of the carbon produced by all the motor vehicles in the United States every year.

Unlike solar or wind energy, hydropower sends species to extinction, displaces communities, and contributes to climate change. New scientific research shows that reservoirs created by dams add nearly a billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents into the air every year, mostly in the form of methane. This happens because the flooding caused by dams sets off chemical reactions as all the trees and grass suddenly underwater start to break down.

Extinction of flora and fauna around the world is tragic, but we are also going to see unprecedented humanitarian crises that will challenge us like never before.

Small variations in the atmospheric concentration of these gases lead to significant changes in temperature that make the difference between ice ages when mammoths roamed planet Earth and the heat in which the dinosaurs dominated the planet. Greenhouses gases are normally characterised using two main indicators: Global Warming Potential – a relative measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere; and the atmospheric lifetime – which measurees the lifetime of the gas in the atmosphere. The first indicator expresses itself in CO2 equivalent (how much more or less greenhousy this gas is compared to CO2) and the second is measured by the time it takes for a gas to disappear from the atmosphere.,p

The reason for this was that, at the time, there were no commercially viable SF6-free alternatives to the existing switchgear. This regulation will be revised in 2020 where new technologies on the market will be assessed to see if they could possibly lead to a reduction in the usage of SF6. In this context, the German company Nuventura is introducing a new technology and design method to remove altogether the need for this gas in electricity grids.

This particular project was a cricket shelter and farm with crickets being a high-protein and low- resource intensive food source in times of dislocation due to climate change. It was a visionary architectural project and now are considering for the next time when this project is installed that we have a 3D tour of that interior with lots of crickets sounds and other features.

2576,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,"First, in partnering with leading environmental organisations such as Earth Day Network, World Wildlife Fund, Oceana, NRDC and, Global Footprint Network. These are some of the world’s leading environmental organisations and by giving them the platform to reach new audiences with their educational and activist content and we are reaching our goal to bring those messages and connect those organisations to more individuals. ",p
2577,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,We have managed to do that by bringing more people on to sites where they can see the work of those important organisations and take a direct role in supporting their initiatives. We have created a series of resources for the individuals who come to the site and are inspired by the artwork to do a few things. ,p
2578,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,"We direct them to a pledge centre which has a curated set of lists that inform people about particular topics. Let’s say it’s about your carbon footprint, then it would have information on the top 50 ways an average individual can reduce their carbon footprint.

2579,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,We give people the opportunity to share some of these actions along with the artwork on social media because social media is an important way that people engage with other members of their network and community. By connecting the social media with activism we’re hoping to amplify the messages and give people manageable approaches to making an impact. ,p

2582,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,"We come from a traditional museum style background. There is a curation process that goes into most projects. When we first launched our online exhibition platform, we did an open call to artists and received artwork submissions from all over the world and from those we selected around 30 artists artwork that we thought would be an inspiration and help launch that platform. ",p
2583,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,That was a deviation from our typical process of connecting with other museums and curators and exploring with our networks artist whose artwork that fit with the mission of the organisation and the message we’re trying to achieve. We have many artists who reach out to us and wish to collaborate. We are always open to considering proposal and ideas but it is primarily a curation driven process to date.,p

",p
2588,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,"We do not select work with the perspective that it is social media friendly.

2594,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,It depends on the project. Travelling exhibitions tend to be a catalyst for local programming in which local activist organisations see it as an amazing opportunity to engage with youth or groups that are affected by the issues that are being addressed. ,p
2595,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,We have had a tremendous amount of programming around some exhibitions such as the Off The Beaten Path exhibition which focused on violence against women.

2596,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,"It tends to happen organically. If it’s the right organisation and there’s a good fit then the partnerships naturally evolve. For example, we have a very strong partnership with the Global Footprint Network. ",p

Given the nature of our high profile partnerships, we are able to get projects done at a scale and visibility that other small organisation wouldn’t be.

2601,https://plana.earth/academy/putting-art-to-work-al-grumet/,Putting Art to Work with Al Grumet,2018-08-25,I think that anywhere one of our shows takes place there is likely to be individuals visiting those exhibitions who are already aware and engaged by those issues and concerns. I think there are people all over the world engaged by those issues and concerns on. We have had exhibitions focused on specific problems that have been located in specific areas.,p

Where we can help amplify the messages of those amazing networks and partners, that’s where we’ll be the most active.

Yep. You do it through their poop. When poop is formed in the intestines, the bacteria that live there get wrapped up with the rest of the faecal material and deposited out when the animal defecates.

Surprisingly – for the non-initiated –  poop is becoming increasingly popular not only in science, but in medicine and veterinary protocols. Specifically, there is a lot of interest around faecal transplants. And here you can put down your food. Faecal transplants are used (in both lemurs and humans) to treat individuals that have gastrointestinal infections. It entails using faeces from a healthy individual, and transplanting it into the gut of the unhealthy individuals.",p

Among lemurs, many species are difficult to keep in captivity because they frequently get gut infections. The veterinary and research team at the DLC have been successfully using faecal transplants to prevent and fight infections in their lemur populations. But, sometimes humans need faecal transplants too. Clostridium difficile is an illness that can cause severe and reoccurring gastrointestinal infections in humans.

I went to for a swim, dived into the water and when I got out I had the idea of the setting up of an organisation I would lead.
